This is a small addon that allows the user to see the real time Euro value of items within World of Warcraft based on the only official conversion of 1 WoW token being possible to buy with either 20 Euro or ~275.000 gold.
The gold price of the tokens is variable and therefore the addon fetches the value every 5 minutes.
